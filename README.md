# ***Goal of the Project (5%)***
+ The goal of this project was to create a web application that users can use for three different features that is displayed on a menu after they login to their account.:
  + Stressometer - Answer a questionaire about their emotions, stress levels, happiness, etc.
  + Journaling - They can use this option to journal about anything they want to just write down which they can access again by just signing into their account.
  + Good News - There are four categories of articles - Animals, Inspiring, Nature, and Laughs - that users can choose from. Once they choose a category, they can randomly generate an article for them to read. 

# ***Significance of the Project (10%)***
+ We wanted to develop this application as a try towards having a resource that people can use for their emotional/mental benefit. Life can be very stressful or many things can happen in life that can bring down a person's mood. There are a lot of resources out there that people can use but we wanted to create an application that combines three good resources out there for support; a stressometer, journaling, and good news. Stressometer is a great way for someone to express how they are feeling without having to write much. Sometimes it can be hard to write down our thoughts so this helps people to just rate how they are feeling and based on that get some advice back. Sometimes being told the simplest advice can help people deal with their problems. The journaling feature can help people write down their thoughts and nobody but them will be able to see it and once they log back in they can re-visit their entries and use that as a way to see how far they have come. Last but not least our good new generator is a simple way to bring some joy into someone's life. Just reading about some of the good in the world or reading cute stories about animals can help people take their minds off of things.

+ Once you click on 'New Terminal', a terminal will pop up and you will be prompted to choose where you want to continue working, Github Codespaces or a New Local Clone. Choose Github Codespaces.
![image](https://github.com/mabraham2o24/463-Final-Project/assets/143213640/db292e30-d3b3-4b47-8331-94a9e9118503)

+ Once you choose github codespaces, you will be prompted to choose the instance type for your code space - 2 Cores, 8GB RAM, 32 GB storage or 4 Cores, 16 GB RAMS, 32 GB storage. You can choose either one depending on your preference and how much space you want it to use.
+ ![image](https://github.com/mabraham2o24/463-Final-Project/assets/143213640/871a3ee7-5591-4254-bc4d-1ad58fbdf281)
  
+ Once you choose either 2 Cores or 4 Cores, a new tab will open up and this will be your codespace.
+ Once the codespace loads, the terminal you are going to run the application is will open up.

# ***Discussion and Conclusions (10%)***
+ Our main project issue was coming together and combining all of our code. For the sake of time and not being to meet all the time we split up this project into parts. Treasure handled the journaling and saving all the information to the database for each user. While I, Mahima, dealt with the login system and good new generator. So, after we finished our individual parts when it came time to combining the codes we had some trouble due to compatibility issues and code errors. We had to spend a bit time on that to get it working together. We both worked together on the Stressometer which did not cause many issues.
+ Our biggest and really only limitation was time. We both had a lot of other work to do for other classes and was busy with personal stuff. Due to that we were not able to spend a lot of time on this project over break like we wanted to. If we had more time we would have added more features to improve our user interface and overall application. We wanted to add more menu options like a sleep tracker. We also wanted to make the good news generator use an API and randomly generate articles rather than hard coding them. Due to our time limit we were not able to implement some of the features we had in mind, but was able to execute the idea on a simple basis.
+ Our goal for this project was to implement one of the algorithms we learned in class. The algorithm that we chose and fit best into our application was quick sort algorithm. We used this for our stressometer option. The user has to fill out a questionaire ranking their emotions and other factors. Once the user submits it, the quick sort algorithm sorts the scores which are used to give the user their results and advice.
